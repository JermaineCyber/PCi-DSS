    <h1>PCI-DSS Compliance Framework</h1>
    <p>The PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) framework is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. The framework is crucial for protecting cardholder data and preventing data breaches and fraud. PCI-DSS compliance helps organizations build and maintain a secure network, protect cardholder data, implement strong access control measures, and regularly monitor and test networks. By adhering to PCI-DSS requirements, organizations can secure their systems, reduce vulnerabilities, and build trust with customers and partners. The framework includes various control categories and specific controls, each with detailed implementation steps to guide organizations in achieving and maintaining compliance.</p>
